### Insights & Findings

- The majority of employees are concentrated in Operations department.
- 60% of employees have at least Bachelor degree.
- There is an equalibrium in terms of genders hiring in the company (Males vs. Females).
- In terms of salaries, Females with 'Master & PHD' get higher salaries than Males. In the other side Males with 'Bachelor & High School' are geting paid more.

**Recommendations:** We need to dig more and deep to figure it out why we have the difference of terms of salaries and know where we can work more and see if we have some people are paid more than other ones.

  These insights empower stakeholders with key business metrics, enabling strategic decision-making.
